# Scattering_TinyImageNet-200
Some personal research code on analyzing deep learning models which works with scattering transform.\

## Dataset
Dataset is Tiny ImageNet-200.Tiny ImageNet Challenge is the course project for Stanford CS231N. Tiny ImageNet has 200 classes and each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images. The images sizes are 64 x 64 pixels.
